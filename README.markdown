A rails test done for the people of digitalnatives.hu

I hope you like it. In a normal, job situation I would have done some
things different but it's OK.

For the integer to numeral transformation I used a gem. Maybe you wanted
me to do it by myself, but you know, good Rails developers are lazy and don't like to do
work others already did!
